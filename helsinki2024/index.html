			<p>How might we work across organisational boundaries and address complex systemic challenges? And how might we design for a proactive government and support emerging futures thinking in government?</p>
   			<p>We want to bridge the gap between the practice of designing services and policies in government and the ideas of systems change and futures. We set out to discover best practices and case studies of breaking silos and zooming out. </p>
   			<p>Designers in government are working more across organisational boundaries, instead of within one organisation or for discrete problems and incremental change in services. <strong>User needs cross sectors and organisations. In order to deliver end-to-end journeys, we need to work with several teams, units, organisations and even beyond government - with volunteer organisations and the private sector.</strong> We are zooming out to take a holistic perspective of strategic challenges, policy outcomes and missions that require a systems-level change. </p>
   			<p>After a decade of active designing in government, the role of design and designers is changing. Our contexts are filled with political, economic and security uncertainties, climate change and new technologies. We are faced with short-termism and cutting costs while promoting long-term thinking and imagining inclusive and diverse futures. At the conference, we look for experiments and critical thinking pushing the boundaries around futures. </p>

			<h2>About the community</h2>	
			<p>The International Design in Government community is a group of design-minded people from governments all over the world. The purpose is to learn from each other, share best practice and design patterns, and discuss shared challenges so that we can try and work on them together.</p>
      <p>If you work in government and you’d like to join the community, the conference and monthly calls, you can <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/intlgovdesign/signup">apply to join the Slack group</a>.</p>
      <p>The community is open to designers, user researchers, content designers, accessibility experts and other design-minded people. In order to join, you must be working embedded in government at any level: national, state or city — this includes consultancies that contract solely for government.</p>

			<p>The conference is organised by <a href="https://medium.com/julkis-muotoilijat">Julkis-muotoilijat</a>, the Finnish government design community, with the support of the wider International Design in Government community. We are working in collaboration with Aalto University’s Design for Government programme, the Department of Culture at the City of Malmö (Sweden), the City of Helsinki (Finland), and designers from the City of Tallinn and the Estonian government.</p>
