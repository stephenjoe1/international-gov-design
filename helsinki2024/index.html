					<h2>Participation</h2>
					<p>Our Participant Experience team is working to make your visit to Helsinki as memorable as possible. As a participant, you will receive a digital guide with travel, accommodation and valuable tips for planning your stay in Finland.</p>
					<p>We will also organise a social programme outside the official sessions and creative and rich experiences to get the most out of the conference</p>
					<p>We have gathered more than 100 ideas from our community on how to make this conference the best conference ever, and we are working on it!</p>
					<p>Remember that you can attend two conferences in the same week. We selected the date and location for this conference to enable participants to attend the <a href="https://www.servicedesignglobalconference.com">Service Design Network’s global conference</a>, which will take place in Helsinki, Finland, in the same week (3-4 October). </p>
					<p>Unfortunately, we can’t cover any travel expenses for participants, but if you need some tips on how to get sponsors, feel free to <a href="mailto:govdesignconference@gmail.com">contact us by email</a>.</p>

			<h2>About the community</h2>	
			<p>The International Design in Government community is a group of design-minded people from governments all over the world. The purpose is to learn from each other, share best practice and design patterns, and discuss shared challenges so that we can try and work on them together.</p>
      <p>If you work in government and you’d like to join the community, the conference and monthly calls, you can <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/intlgovdesign/signup">apply to join the Slack group</a>.</p>
      <p>The community is open to designers, user researchers, content designers, accessibility experts and other design-minded people. In order to join, you must be working embedded in government at any level: national, state or city — this includes consultancies that contract solely for government.</p>
      <p><a href="mailto:intl-govdesign-team@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">Email the community management team</a> if you have any questions.</p>
