					<h2>Format</h2>
					<p>On 29 November 2023, we’re running an all-day global event. We’ll have 24 sessions – so, at least 24 countries will participate, but not more than 1 contribution per country.<br> <br> The aim is to bring together colleagues from all parts of the globe – not just the Global North, and co-create the most complete overview of the state of government innovation.<br><br>Each session is around 45 minutes; each session is different. Some people will present work; others will take a more interactive approach. Some sessions have multiple presenters with several short inputs, and others have a longer talk with time for questions.</p>

					<h2>Participation</h2>
					<p>The 24-hour remote conference is open and free to attend for any member of the International Design in Government community. The topic of the conference is broad: public sector service innovation.</p>
					<p>We will use Hopin as the event platform. You get immediate access as a community member.</p>
					<p>If you work in government and you’d like to join the community, the conference and monthly calls, you can apply to join the Slack group.</p><br>

			<h2>About the community</h2>	
			<p>The International Design in Government community is a group of design-minded people from governments all over the world. The purpose is to learn from each other, share best practice and design patterns, and discuss shared challenges so that we can try and work on them together.</p>
      <p>If you work in government and you’d like to join the community, the conference and monthly calls, you can <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/intlgovdesign/signup">apply to join the Slack group</a>.</p>
      <p>The community is open to designers, user researchers, content designers, accessibility experts and other design-minded people. In order to join, you must be working embedded in government at any level: national, state or city — this includes consultancies that contract solely for government.</p>
