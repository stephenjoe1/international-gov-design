				</div>
				<div class="column-half">

					<p>The 24-hour remote conference is open and free to attend for any member of the International Design in Government community. The topic of the conference is broad: public sector service innovation.</p>

						<p><span class="font-bold">How might we enable public service professionals to use plain language?</span><br>In Germany, the public sector is often criticized for its bureaucratic language, evident on websites, forms, and official letters, making public administration seem unapproachable, inaccessible, and overly complex. The lack of design in both layout and content results in negative experiences for citizens and unnecessary challenges for staff.<br>The city of cologne wants to provide better public services and reduce the everyday challenges for public sector professionals by establishing plain language as the standard. In response, the city's innovation lab, has introduced a new initiative: the Form Labs. In a short period of time, an interdisciplinary team uses human-centred approaches.<br>Simone and Janina will offer insights into their overarching approach and showcase how they utilize their acquired knowledge to enhance the adoption of plain language within various departments.</p> <p class="small-type-2">Janina Rösch, Innovation Manager, City of Cologne & Simone Carrier, Simone Carrier, Senior Manager & Service Designer, PwC</p>

						<p><span class="font-bold">Digital-ready policy enabled by service design – and better public services through digital-ready policy</span><br>Good services and experiences with government need good laws. In the past, too many laws have been written narrowly, prescribing solutions for the present – making them unfit for an ever-evolving digital landscape. The Federal Ministry of the Interior and DigitalService have been working on a digital check for new laws. Guided by five core principles, policy drafters and legists are supported in making their laws future-proof and enabling good services from the start.</p> <p class="small-type-2">Sabrina Feuerherd, Senior Service Designer, DigitalService</p>

As a result, some of the most vulnerable groups that may not have access to digital services are stuck with outdated and more complicated paper-based services.
