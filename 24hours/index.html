						<p><span class="font-bold">How might we enable public service professionals to use plain language?</span><br>In Germany, the public sector is often criticized for its bureaucratic language, evident on websites, forms, and official letters, making public administration seem unapproachable, inaccessible, and overly complex. The lack of design in both layout and content results in negative experiences for citizens and unnecessary challenges for staff.<br><br>The City of Cologne wants to provide better public services and reduce the everyday challenges for public sector professionals by establishing plain language as the standard. In response, the city’s innovation lab has introduced a new initiative: the Form Labs. In a short period of time, an interdisciplinary team uses human-centred approaches.<br><br>Simone and Janina will offer insights into their overarching approach and showcase how they utilize their acquired knowledge to enhance the adoption of plain language within various departments.</p> <p class="small-type-2">Janina Rösch, Innovation Manager, City of Cologne & Simone Carrier, Simone Carrier, Senior Manager & Service Designer, PwC</p>

						<p><span class="font-bold">Co-creating products with Federal court staff </span><br>Making information on laws and regulations accessible to everyone – that’s the goal of an effort by the Federal Ministry of Justice and DigitalService.

In a short talk, Jana and Sophia will share how they collaborate closely with court staff and subject matter experts in co-creative ways to make these tools work for them.</p> <p class="small-type-2">Jana Weidinger, Product Manager & Sophia Grote, UX/UI Designer, DigitalService</p>

						<p><span class="font-bold">Digital-ready policy enabled by service design – and better public services through digital-ready policy</span><br>Good services and experiences with government need good laws. In the past, too many laws have been written narrowly, prescribing solutions for the present – making them unfit for an ever-evolving digital landscape. The Federal Ministry of the Interior and DigitalService have been working on a digital check for new laws. Guided by five core principles, policy drafters and legists are supported in making their laws future-proof and enabling good services from the start.</p> <p class="small-type-2">Sabrina Feuerherd, Senior Service Designer, DigitalService</p>

			<h2>About the community</h2>	
			<p>The International Design in Government community is a group of design-minded people from governments all over the world. The purpose is to learn from each other, share best practice and design patterns, and discuss shared challenges so that we can try and work on them together.</p>
      <p>If you work in government and you’d like to join the community, the conference and monthly calls, you can <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/intlgovdesign/signup">apply to join the Slack group</a>.</p>
      <p>The community is open to designers, user researchers, content designers, accessibility experts and other design-minded people. In order to join, you must be working embedded in government at any level: national, state or city — this includes consultancies that contract solely for government.</p>
      <p><a href="intl-govdesign-team@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">Email the community management team</a> if you have any questions.</p>
